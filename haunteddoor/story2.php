    <h1>The Mysterious Door</h1>
    <div class='story'>
        <p>A strange, black iron door appears in your basement one morning. It wasn’t there the night before, and no one else in your family seems to notice it. When you open it, a blinding light engulfs you, and you find yourself in the same basement—but decades earlier. You overhear voices upstairs and realize they belong to your grandparents, who are your age now. Exploring further, you discover a series of letters and objects hidden in the house that reveal long-kept family secrets—some heartwarming, some devastating. But the door only opens for a few hours each day, and you begin to suspect that meddling with the past has unforeseen consequences. Can you learn what you need to without changing too much of the present?</p>
