    <h1>The Mysterious Door</h1>
    <div class='story'>
        <p>As you approach the door, you feel a cold draft and hear faint whispers from the other side. The door itself is ancient, covered in moss, and feels like it has been waiting for centuries. Your heart races as you reach out to grab the handle. With a deep breath, you twist the knob and push open the door...</p>
        <p>Suddenly, you're pulled into a dark room filled with shadows. You try to move, but your feet are frozen to the ground. The room feels alive, breathing with an energy you can't explain. You hear footsteps, growing closer and closer...</p>
        <p>Will you find your way out, or is this the beginning of an eternal journey through the unknown? Only time will tell. But remember, not all doors should be opened...</p>
