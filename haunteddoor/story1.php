    <h1>The Mysterious Door</h1>
    <div class='story'>
        <p>Walking home late one night, you stumble upon a heavy wooden door in the middle of the forest. It's standing upright, unattached to any wall. There's an engraving at the top: "For the Curious." You hesitate but then open it to reveal a mirror-like surface. When you step through, you're in a strange, shadowy version of your town. It’s the same... yet not. The streets are deserted, and the lights flicker with an unnatural glow. You soon realize you’ve entered a world that reveals hidden truths: lies people have told, secrets they keep, and emotions they bury. As you navigate this unsettling realm, you begin to uncover mysteries about yourself that you never wanted to confront. But the more you learn, the harder it becomes to find the door back to your normal life.
